In the spirit of RFC-1121:

Our networks, which art Ethernet, hallowed be thy packets.
IPv6 has come, upgrades will be done,
  in Fiber as it was in Twisted Pair.
Give us this network without spanning tree loops,
  and forgive us our static routes,
  as we forgave NetBIOS in others.
And lead us not into plesiochronicity,
  but deliver us from circuit emulation,
  for DWDM and OTN are the power and the glory,
  forever and ever, amen.


Switched Ethernet is my shepherd, I shall not collide.
It maketh me convert Appletalk heretics, it leadeth me to
  the patch panels.
It restoreth my server connections; it guideth me along the
  pseudowires for communication's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
  Token-Ring, I shall fear no packets, for Switched
  Ethernet is with me.
Thy patch cable and thy ODTR, they comfort me.
Thou hast preparedest a router before me in the presence
  of a switching fabric.
Thou hast annointed my cables with QSPF transceivers; my
  buffers runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow our network
  until the next upgrade.
