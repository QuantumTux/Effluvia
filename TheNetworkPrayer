Our networks, which art Ethernet, hallowed be thy packets.
IPv6 has come, upgrades will be done,
  in Fiber as it was in Twisted Pair.
Give us this network without spanning tree loops,
  and forgive us our static routes,
  as we forgave NetBIOS in others.
And lead us not into plesiochronicity,
  but deliver us from circuit emulation,
  for DWDM and OTN are the power and the glory,
  forever and ever, amen.
