# Effluvia
A bunch of things that aren't code; plus a [wiki for various musings](https://github.com/QuantumTux/Effluvia/wiki)

## AnInterestingDNS.pdf
This paper describes a DNS solution I created to meet a very specific need in a multi-architecture build environment with a complex network arrangement.

## AndThenThereWasBOOTP.pdf
Another paper about the multi-architecture environment. This time, I'm describing **BOOTP** and configuration of **dhcpd** in support of multi-architecture builds.

## IPv4ClassCSubnettingTables.pdf
A decade or so ago I chanced across this table and have never been able to re-locate this **exact** source; others are similar, but never an exact match (I also lost the original file, so I don't even know the name). In any event, given an [IPv4 Class C address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network#Classful_addressing_definition), it shows the possible subnets that can be created (neglecting the last 2 bits, of course). I re-created it in **LibreOffice Calc** and added the slash notation.

## SFB-TacticalMap-By-DavidBank.jpg
I used to play [Star Fleet Battles](http://www.starfleetgames.com/starfleetbattles.shtml) a lot (like weekly). There was never a really good tactical map specifically for the game, so I decided to design one. This is a JPEG image of the result; it's a standard 42-by-30 hex, sized for the 1-inch counters (from **Module H**). Around the border of the map is the SFB *Sequence of Play* (extracted from **Annex #2**), with references to the specific rules named. Unscaled. the image is about 48 inches by 44 inches; as most large-format printers top out at about 36 inches (as a maximum dimension), it'd likely need an (expensive) custom print job to produce.


## TheNetworkPrayer
A little bit of whimsey, in the spirit of [RFC 1121](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1121)
